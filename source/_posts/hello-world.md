title: Hello World
---

I have been meaning to write blogs for a long time now. I have considered
doing so with WordPress in past, but I have seen enough struggles and horrors
my friends at [Evincism](https://evincism.com/) experienced with it that
I have so far avoided it. I don't really feel like voluntarily dealing with
PHP.

Funnily enough, I will soon start a new job at [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com)
which is a company selling WordPress solutions -- fate has made dealing with
WordPress unavoidable for me.

I really enjoy plain-text editing and have been thinking of writing my own
blogging platform that allows publishing articles written in MarkDown or a
similar plain-text format.
*(spoiler: I never sat down to actually do that)*

Yesterday, while looking for a cheap .moe domain for my personal site and blog,
and browsing [featured sites on nic.moe](https://nic.moe/featured), I ended
up on [skk.moe](https://skk.moe) which is a website owned by a core team member
of Hexo. It drew my attention. While experimenting with it I realised it was
exactly what I have been looking for. Hexo is simple, configurable with YML,
and generates static sites -- perfect!

I decided to finally start my own blog with Hexo and here we are. I have
decided to leave the theme (and most configuration actually) to default  for
now but I will probably be writing my own once I find time to do so.

*Below lies the original body of the "Hello Word" article Hexo comes with by
default. I left it there because why not.*
